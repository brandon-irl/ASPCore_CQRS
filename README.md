CQRS in ASP.NET Core
======
A sample application demonstrating the CQRS pattern in ASP.NET Core using [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR)

Showing how to decouple application logic from webapi using the mediator pattern.

Demonstrates simple queries, async commands, and pipelines initiated from a web request.

This is based on the template application currently provided through `dotnet new webapi`.

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/brandon-irl/ASPCore_CQRS/wiki) for full explanation of approach and implementation.
